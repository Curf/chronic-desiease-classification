# chronic-desiease-classification
In this study, we employ both binary and multi-label approaches to classifying chronic disease diagnoses based on the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data, provided by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC).

The BRFSS datasets and associated documentation are publicly available and published annually on the CDCâ€™s website at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm.
